Hey, I'm Kelsey 👋
Front-End Developer · Systems Thinker · Always Building Something New

I came to software development from an unconventional path... years as an Instrumentation Engineering Technologist, calibrating complex industrial systems and troubleshooting in high-stakes environments. During the pandemic I discovered front-end development, fell completely in love with it, and haven't stopped building since.
Turns out the same brain 🧠 that loves reading P&IDs also really loves writing React components. Who knew. ✨
